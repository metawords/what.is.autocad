AutoCAD is the starting of modeling and designing on a digital platform. This is a CAD software application developed by Autodesk in the year 1982. Prior to the intent of this application, people used to design and create sketches and models by hand. This obviously was a troublesome task. Also, it took a lot of time and money. But with the invent of AutoCAD, everything got simplified and easier. It is a powerful program used across the globe by engineers, architects, students, graphic designers, and even fashion designers.


## How does AutoCAD make working so easy?

It specializes in developing great artwork by saving time and effort. It is also helpful in creating a reusable library and smooth edits. It works best with commands such as copy, rotate, scale and stretching.

These allow the designer to draw precise artworks with fractional dimensions that reduce the risk of errors. Also, these precise drawings are impossible to achieve with manual drafts. This is how it makes the workings of users easier, time saver and effortless.
